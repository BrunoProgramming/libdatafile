daq-client
==========

The `daq-client` component of the `mearec` application provides a 
library for interacting with the `daqsrv` program, which runs on the
Windows machine interfacing directly with the National Instruments 
A/D card. 

The `DaqClient` class is the main object described here. It provides
a way to connect to, interact with, and stream data from the `daqsrv` 
program into memory.
